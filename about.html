                        <p>
                            Hello, thank you for visiting my site!
                        </p>
                            The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio with pages about my work experience, education, notable projects, project papers completed, and my tech stack.
                            Although the majority of this information can be found on my resume, building this has served as a great introduction into web development for me.
                        <p>
                            As a highly motivated and accomplished Data Scientist, I bring a strong academic background and some valuable industry 
                            experience in the healthcare and e-commerce sectors. With excellent interpersonal skills, I thrive in group learning and working 
                            environments. I have a proven track record of balancing my career with other pursuits, including the arts, sports, and 
                            community involvement. On this page of the website, I will briefly introduce my interests outside of work to give a better sense of who I am.
                        </p>
