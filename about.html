                        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hello, thank you for visiting my site!
                            <br><br>
                            The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio with pages about my work experience, education, notable projects, project papers completed, and my tech stack.
                            Although the majority of this information can be found on my resume, building this has served as a great introduction into web development for me.
                            <br><br>
                            As a highly motivated and accomplished Data Scientist, I bring a strong academic background and some valuable industry 
                            experience in the healthcare and e-commerce sectors. With excellent interpersonal skills, I thrive in group learning and working 
                            environments. I have a proven track record of balancing my career with other pursuits, including the arts, sports, and 
                            community involvement. Below I will briefly introduce my interests outside of work to give a better sense of who I am.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Interests:</h1>
                        <p>Although my work and studies play a central role in my life, I have always put an emphasis on maintaining a good balance. I have many interests including the arts, sports, and community involvement.
                            The two most prominent of which would be sports and music.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Sports:</h3>
                        <p>
                            My favourite sports have always been two of the Irish traditional ones, hurling and gaelic football. These sports require focus, athleticism, and a lot of skill,    
                            they kept me entertained and busy for most of my childhood. In my opinion hurling is the most entertaining sport to watch, it's title as 'fastest sport on land in the world'
                            demonstrates this. I am proud to have captained my hurling club at a high level, and represented my county at underage levels.<br><br>
                            Here are links to watch some great moments in hurling over the years:

                            <br><br>
                            Another sport that I have a keen interest in is rugby. Recently Ireland have been competing with the best in the world in this sport and it has been great to watch. I am
                            proud to have played at a high level with my school, with which I won the prestigious Munster School's Senior Cup.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Music:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Music has also been a constant throughout my life, having studied the violin and cello since I was 6 years old. Unfortunately, I looked at music as a chore for many of
                            my teenage years and have struggled to fully get back in to playing since leaving school. Despite this attitude problem, I am very happy to have achieved grade 8 qualifications
                            from the Cork School of Music. I am determined to play more music in the future.
                            <br><br>
